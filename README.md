# Overlook

Overlook is a simple macOS menu bar application that provides a convenient way to activate Mission Control, especially for mouse users.

## The Problem

When using a mouse with a Mac, especially when not physically near the machine, it can be cumbersome to switch between applications and spaces without using keyboard shortcuts. Accessing Mission Control, a key feature for managing windows and spaces, typically requires a dedicated key or a gesture on the trackpad.

## The Solution

Overlook solves this problem by providing a simple icon in the menu bar. A single click on the icon activates Mission Control, making it easily accessible with just a mouse.

## Features

-   **One-Click Mission Control:** Activate Mission Control with a single click from your menu bar.
-   **Mouse-Friendly:** Designed for users who primarily use a mouse for navigation.
-   **Lightweight:** Overlook is a lightweight application that runs in the background without consuming significant system resources.
